# hello-world
This is the place where I'm gonna store my ideas, my resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
My name is Furkan. I am here to learn to code and advance my skills in data science by using r, python and sql.
I am so excited to learn how to code and I cannot stop myself to imagine how am I going to be after 3 months :)
